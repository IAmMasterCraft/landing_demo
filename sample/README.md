## The App:
I designed a bank app where users can login and sign up to, making transaction
easy for them with the means of an app or web, helping user to solve to issue of
going to the bank to queue to make transaction, helping them bank easy.
and making it easy for them to track or follow up on any made in or out of their account
through the means of a visualization.
i made sure in designing an easy approach to fit in for any type of person in the society
be it a doctor or a trader, very easy to navigate and understand in accomplishing any task
a user wants to acheive.

## Color:
I used a purple colour as the main colour and an orange colour 
for the secondary colour, purple simplifies luxury or comfort it 
and orange has a relaxing and exciting feel, i used both colours
to make my design feel luxurious and exciting to the eye.

## Margin:
I used a margin line of 24pixel on the mobile and 24pixel and 50pixel on the web
by doing that it would be easy for the user to be able to scan 
information fast without straining the eye. The design wouldnt be 
congested by doing

## Icons:
I used filled icon to represent an active icon and and outlined icon
to represent an inactive icon 

## Font:
Roboto font was used for the UI design, the font is a friendly and and easy 
to read font which is a appropriate for a bank app
